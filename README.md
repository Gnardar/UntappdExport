Untappd Export Scripts

1. In Firefox or Chrome go to https://untappd.com/login and login
2. Click on "Unique" in the top right under your name
3. Hit F12 to bring up the developer console
4. Copy in the Functions into the Console from exportbeerlist.js
5. Run load_beers(); until you see it say all beers were loaded, loads 25 at a time.. I tried to loop this and broke the site :)
